      <h2 id="tribute-info">The Artist: Edgar Degas</h2>
      <p id="intro">
        Edgar Degas was born as Hilaire-Germain-Edgar De Gas on July 19 1863 in
        Paris, France. He is regarded as one of the founders of the Impessionist
        Movement, though he disliked the term and prefered to be called a
        realist. And unlike many of the Impressionists of that time he did not
        paint outdoors. He prefered to paint indoors relying on photos, memory
        or live models.
      </p>
      <p id="intro2">
        Degas was a superb draftsman and in particular was a master of depicting
        movement. This is seen in many of this subject matters depicting
        dancers, horses, racejockies, women bathing. He worked in several
        mediums such as oil paint, pastels, charcol, etching, monotype, wax
        scuplting, and sometimes bronze casting.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we look at art works by Degas we will go over the draftsman ship and
        process he took to create his completed works of art.
      </p>
      <h2>The Dance Class</h2>
      <p>
        The Dance Class depicts some 24 Ballerinas with their mothers waiting
        during an examination of a ballerina in the center of the painting being
        conducted by ballet master, Jules Perrot (gentleman on the right side of
        the image). This painting has an uptilted perspective that rushes us
        into the scene. Degas would change and shift dancers in this scene as he
        worked. He would sketch figures in various positions and when then
        adding them to the image he would then shift the figures or add figures
        to suit the composition. Even the scene depicted in the paiting is of
        imaginary set rehearsal room in the old Paris Opera which had recently
        burned down during the time of this painting.

      <h2>The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer</h2>
      <p>
        Upon Degas's death in 1917, more than 150 figurative sculptures were
        found in his studio. Most were made of fragile wax, clay, and plastiline
        (a wax- and oil-based modeling material). Many had deteriorated. Only a
        some of these sculptures were preserved in copies cast in plaster.
        Although Degas did not favor reproducing his sculptures in more
        permanent materials, his heirs authorized copies to be cast in bronze in
        order to preserve the compositions and to sell them as finished works.
        Degas was self taught in sculpture and made numerous wax models on wire
        armatures. The subjects were dancers, women bathing, and horses just
        like his subjects in his paintings, but the sculptural studies are not
        preparatory for specific oil canvases. They were more for independent
        explorations of three-dimensional form. He would show the wac scupltures
        to friends and ordered plaster casts of three of them during his
        lifetime, so their creation was not an entirely private activity. But
        the only one he ever exhibited in public was the wax version of Little
        Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer. Degas made the sculpture of tinted wax with
        real cloth, tulle, and ribbon, and the result reminded many viewers of
        the displays in Madame Tussaud’s wax museum in London.
      </p>
      <p>
        Degas’s model was the young Marie van Goethem (born June 7, 1865), a
        student at the École de Danse and by 1880 a professional dancer at the
        Paris Opéra. Degas’s sketches of Marie indicate his intense
        concentration on her form. The artist would frequent the Opéra, making
        endless studies of dancers in motion and at rest. In the bronze, shown
        below model is in a classic ballet stance, with her right leg advanced
        and turned. But there is a deliberate awkwardness to the pose in the way
        that the arms jut down behind and the head tilts back. In addition many
        thought of the features of this adolescent were far from pretty.
